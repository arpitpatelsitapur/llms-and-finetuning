# LLMs and Fine-Tuning

Welcome to the **LLMs and Fine-Tuning** repository! This repo contains my journey of learning and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuning techniques. All the apps and projects in this repository are built using resources from various online platforms, including YouTube tutorials, official documentation, and other community resources.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains code and resources related to:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Experimentation with LLM architectures like Transformers, GPT, BERT, LLaMA, etc.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Techniques to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt them to specific tasks.
- **NLP Projects**: Practical implementations of chatbots, text generators, and other NLP applications using fine-tuned models.

## üìö Learning Resources

The learning and code implementations in this repository are based on:

- **YouTube tutorials**: Various helpful videos covering LLMs, fine-tuning, and NLP applications.
- **Official Documentation**: Reference materials from frameworks such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta AI (LLaMA), TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- **Community Articles and Blogs**: Insights and techniques shared by the AI/ML community.
